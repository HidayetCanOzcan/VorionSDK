Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Instead of explicitly programming rules, machine learning systems can learn from data.

Key differences between AI and ML:
1. Scope: AI is a broader concept aiming to create intelligent machines, while ML is a specific approach to achieve AI.
2. Functionality: AI systems can make decisions, while ML systems learn patterns from data.
3. Goal: The goal of AI is to increase the chances of success, not accuracy, while ML specifically aims to increase accuracy of a model.

Both AI and ML are crucial in today's technological landscape, driving innovations in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.
